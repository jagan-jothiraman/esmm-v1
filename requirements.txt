pandas>=1.1.0
scikit-learn>=0.23.0
numpy>=1.18.0
pyarrow>=1.0.0
PyYAML>=5.3 # For potential future YAML configs or if EasyRec implicitly uses it
# google-cloud-storage>=1.30.0 # For direct GCS operations
# gcsfs>=0.6.0 # For pandas to read directly from GCS via fsspec
jupyter>=1.0.0 # For notebooks

# EasyRec installation is assumed to be handled separately in the environment.
# EasyRec has its own complex dependencies (e.g., specific TensorFlow versions).
# Refer to EasyRec documentation for compatible TensorFlow versions.
# Example: tensorflow>=1.12,<=1.15 or tensorflow>=2.0,<=2.12 depending on EasyRec version.
# For CPU-only TensorFlow, you might use 'tensorflow-cpu'.

# Note: If using the --execute_training flag in generate_and_run_train.py,
# the environment must have EasyRec and its dependencies (like TensorFlow) installed.
